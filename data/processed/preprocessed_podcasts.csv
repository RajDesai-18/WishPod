Chris and I were two IV heroin addicts who loved to talk about all the coke we smoked, snorted and shot, all the pills we ate, smoked, all the weed we smoked and ate, all the booze we consumed and all the consequences we suffered. After making the show for 2 and a half years, Chris tragically relapsed and died from a fentanyl overdose. Dopey continued on, at first to mourn the horrible loss of Chris, but then to continue our mission - which was at its core, to keep addicts and alcoholics company. Whether to laugh at our time in rehab, or cry at the worst missteps we made, Dopey tells the truth about drugs, addiction and recovery. We continually mine the universe for stories rife with debauchery and highlight serious drug taking and alcoholism. We also examine different paths toward addiction recovery. We shine a light on harm reduction and medication assisted treatment. We talk with celebrities and nobodies and stockpile stories to be the greatest one stop shop podcast on all things drugs, addiction, recovery and comedy pathfinding the route to the heart of the opioid epidemic.",Dave & Chris,527,True,0,https://open.spotify.com/show/3woZxvcZy5hpYX1ODKoC1y,en,https://i.scdn.co/image/ab6765630000ba8a550119e497b01ef4d2633f53,comedy,0.05606480494564059,1,1

Welcome to Rom-Com Vom: where in every episode we go under the covers with a beloved rom-com, strip away its hidden toxic messages, and rewrite the script on love + sex.  --- ABOUT ROM-COM VOM: Did our favorite rom-coms we adored growing up totally warp our ideas about love, relationships, dating, and sex? Spoiler alert: they sure did, and we’re here to talk about it! Join DB (Sex Educator & Pleasure Expert) and her renowned guests like Franchesca Ramsey (Comedian), Logan Ury (Dating Coach), Justine Kay and Natasha Scott-Reichel (Hosts of 2 Black Girls, 1 Rose), Reed Amber and Florence Bark (Hosts of Come Curious), and more as we dissect popular rom-coms like You’ve Got Mail, Never Been Kissed, 10 Things I Hate About You, Twilight, Hitch, How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days, and more.  --- We’ll dive into the swoon-worthy moments and cringe-worthy toxic lessons, unpacking how these movies shaped (and messed up) our views on healthy relationships and what sex should be like. And don’t worry—we’re rewriting the script with ideas on how these films could’ve done better.

Did it prepare you to have a healthy and happy relationship with sex and identity? If it was anything like DB’s, it was stigmatizing, judgmental, and totally unhelpful. But not to worry, the experts are here to offer the sex ed you wish you had. --- We cover an array of sex education topics like orgasms, abortion, pornography, fetishes and kinks, pleasure, consent and boundaries, healthy relationships, LGBTQIA+ mental health and sexual health, LGBTQIA+ relationships, coming out, sexual dysfunction and pain during sex, birth control, sex in the media, Queer stories, and so much more. We believe that everyone deserves comprehensive, inclusive, pleasure-centered, feminist, medically-accurate sex education. On the show, DB and sexual health expert guests break down your most curious sex questions like “Am I pregnant?” or “How can I have a stronger orgasm?” or “How do I keep the spark alive in a long-term relationship?” or “How often should I be having sex?” or “What are common sexual fetishes?” or “What are the benefits of masturbation?” Tune in for expert insights and candid conversations redefining sexual health and empowerment! --- ABOUT DB: Danielle Bezalel (she/her), aka DB, has a Master of Public Health from Columbia University with expertise in sexuality, sexual, and reproductive health.
